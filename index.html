       <h2>Everybody Loves Seattle Food Trucks
        The Seattle food scene took it’s cue from Portland about 8 years ago when a few burgeoning food truck-preneurs took to the streets to hawk their culinary wares. The likes of Josh Henderson of Skillet fame, Roz and Kamala from Marination and Matt Lewis from Where Ya At Matt? were all at the forefront of the revolution for Seattle Food Trucks.
        
        Early on, Health Department regulations made it difficult to operate in this city as well as land use restrictions. Food trucks were forced to operate in specific spaces by permission of the land or property owner. That’s all changed now and it’s due in large part to the efforts of these pioneers in the industry.
        
        If you’re interested in learning more about the history of food trucks in Seattle and the true cost of operating a truck – read this piece I wrote about a year ago on Food Truck Economics.</h2>
